If you work on a team with any remote members, you should always optimize for those that are not in the room.

Those in the office have it easy. If I'm in the office, communication is high bandwidth. Solutions to my problems are only a few desks away. Everything is set up for me. For the remote employee. everything is through the 2D filter of their laptop.

And so I strongly urge you - always optimize for the remote ones. Anything shy of this is unfair.

Her are three ways to improve the life of your remote employees:

# 1. Keep all communication online
Make a conscience effort to have conversations on Slack (or whatever your tool of choice is). If a decision is made in real life, make sure to communicate this out via online channels. If a meeting is held that not all people can attend, make sure to record it and share it out. Don't keep the remote employees in the dark.

# 2. Don't have meetings in a room
One of the biggest mistakes I see teams make is to have their meetings in a big meeting room and then 'dial in' the remote employees. If you've ever been on the receiving end of 'dialing in' you know. It sucks. Instead, have everyone dial in. One to two people per computer, max. This levels the playing field quickly.

# 3. Be more asynchronous
This one is hard, but moves you ever closer to remote nirvana. By removing compulsory meetings and fixed work times you start to favor all employees, not matter where they are. This requires a shift in process.  

<br />

Just by implementing these three things, you will start to build a culture which supports remote employees. Without these things, remote employees will feel left out, and probably wont last very long.
