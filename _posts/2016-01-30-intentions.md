One thing I love about Yoga practice is that at the beginning of a session, the instructor will often ask you to lay out your intentions for that days practice.

That may be focusing on your breathing. Or being more mindful. Or strength in all poses. Regardless of what is it, it provides focus and a personal purpose to your practice.

Applying that here, I think it's best I lay out my intentions for this blog. I have no doubt that they will change, but taking a snapshot now provides opportunities for insight in the future.

# 1. Clearness of writing, clarity of thought.

By articulating my thoughts into written word I hope that I can both distill my thoughts and at the same time, improve my writing style.

# 2. Improve my credibility

I now have over 5 years of software development experience. And nearly the same amount working in agile, remote teams. Yet, a Google search about me returns none of this.

# 3. Help others

I have slowly accrued tips and tricks through both extensive reading, and practice. Hopefully I can prevent others making the same mistakes I have.
