As a company, supporting remote is not binary.

Zach Holman touched on this when he blogged about [Remote-first vs Remote-friendly][zach-post].

On one the side of the spectrum, is a company which caters completely to remote employees. The "Remote-first" company.  In many cases, the company is made up of only remote employees. It's easier this way. Every ritual, process, and cultural nuance supports the remote worker.

For most of these companies, they were born remote. The likes of Buffer or Github. It's in their blood.

For a company to be truly remote, there should be no difference whether I'm inside the office or not. 

It shouldn't matter when I work. I should be wholey based on my output.  

On the other side of the spectrum is a co-located single office. Ignoring this boring maximum, companies first start to dip their toes in a variety of ways. Maybe by supporting work from home. Or by employing offshore contractors. Often this arrangement places undue stress on the remote individual. Meetings are not set up to support them. Most conversations happen in real life. They wear the pain.


Somewhere in the middle is a mixed office. A few remote employees. Maybe a remote team. Sometimes this can work very well.


Many companies are attempting to transition along this spectrum but get caught at key sticking points. The biggest being different timezone.

A true remote-first culture is a necessity to fully support cross timezone collaboration./
