Remote work is becoming easier and easier. Internet speeds are getting faster. Products are getting better. Here are my top ten favorite tools for getting the jobs done.

# Video Calling: [Zoom][zoom]

Zoom is best in class. It works pretty well at low Internet speeds, has a great mobile app, and has no limits of participants. Google Hangouts and Skype are OK, but Zoom is better. Seriously.

# Screen Sharing: [ScreenHero][screenhero]

Screen sharing on tools like Zoom or Skype sucks! It's one way and really doesn't allow for collaboration. ScreenHero fixes that. Both of you can interact with one computer. Perfect for Pair Programming or quick demos.

# Collaboration: [Google Docs][google-docs]

When it comes to document collaboration, you're hard pushed to beat Google docs. It's free and it works.

# Timezones: [The Clock][clock]

When working remotely knowing what time is it around the world is super important. I use this handy mac app to let me know what time it is where all my teammates (and friends) are. Super cool

# Project Mangement: [Trello][trello]

Depending on how you work, Trello is one of the best tools around for managing workload. It's fast, flexible, and light weight. Best for Kan-ban work flows.

# Version Control: [Github][github]

The poster boy of Web 2.0 products.

# Design: [Invision][invision]

Design is a conversation.

# Working Offline: [Dash][dash]

As a developer, sometimes you need to read the documentation. And sometimes you don't have the Internet. Dash solves this problem and makes getting work done on planes (or other remote locations) easy. Just make sure you install everything you need before you embark!

# Productivity: [Pomodo One][pomodo]

This is technically not a tool for remote work, but here me out. One of the challenges of being a remote worker is managing your time. It has never been easier to get distracted. Pomodo One helps fix that. Work in 25 minute bursts to get more done!

# Hardware: A good headset

Finally, this deserves special mentions.
